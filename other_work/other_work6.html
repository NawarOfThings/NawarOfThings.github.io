            <h1><span><i class='bx bxs-star'></i> Engineering Student Ambassador</span></h1>
            <h2>Feb 2024 ➜ July 2025</h2>
            <p style="align-items: left; text-align: left;">
                Being a student ambassador at Sheffield meant welcoming hundreds of visitors and making sure their first impression of the university feels personal and supportive. From delivering presentations to lecture theatres packed with hundreds of guests, to answering one-to-one questions about courses, campus life and everything in between – I’ve learned how to adapt quickly to diverse audiences. <br> <br>
                
                Working with a team of ten to thirteen ambassadors, I’ve helped run interactive workshops, kept schedules on track, and even voluntarily stepped in to reorganise visitor flow during peak hours, which turned potential bottlenecks into smooth, non-chaotic experiences. <br><br>
                
                What made the role so valuable to me was how much it sharpened my communication and adaptability. Every conversation is different, and every group needs a slightly different approach. It’s a chance to represent the engineering departments and university life well, but also to grow the kind of skills one can only develop by standing up in front of strangers and making them feel at home.
