            <h1> Digital Exclusion Charity Project</h1>
            <p style="align-items: left; text-align: left;">
                When I first arrived at Sheffield for my studies, I was astounded by the natural beauty, the city's welcoming-ness, and the amount of homeless people in the city. This bothered me greatly, and I felt a strong urge to contribute to the fight against homelessness in some way. <br><br>

                Luckily for me, ChangeLab – the charitable organisation at our Students' Union – was about to launch their new 'Digital Exclusion' project in collaboration with Roundabout Homeless Charity. The aim was to collect unused phones and electronic devices from students for homeless youth in South Yorkshire, via a phone bank placed in our bubbling Students' Union. <br><br>

                I immediately volunteered to be part of the project, putting myself as the coordinator, and crafted a roadmap outlining the 8-week timeline, which united our volunteer team of eight towards a common goal. As part of my role, I also helped with the promotion of the project, creating posters and social media posts to raise awareness and encourage participation. On top of that, my friend (a volunteer as well) and I forged an alliance with a local phone repair shop to help restore any damaged devices, ensuring that no donation would go to waste. <br><br>

                Within just one week, our initiative collected more than 23 working phones! Even better, the phone bank continues to collect devices long after our project ended (when I went back to check two years later, it was still going strong, which was an incredible surprise). <br><br>

                This experience was deeply rewarding, as it allowed me to make a lasting difference in the lives of homeless youth in our community. It also taught me valuable skills in project management, teamwork, and communication, which I have carried into many other areas of my life. <br><br>

                Overall, I am proud to have been part of an initiative that not only provided immediate support but also created a sustainable way for students to contribute to tackling homelessness in Sheffield. It showed me the power of collective action – how even just a small amount of collaborative effort goes a long way in making a positive impact.
