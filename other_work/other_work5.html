            <p style="align-items: left; text-align: left;">
                Being the inclusions officer for two societies Iâ€™m genuinely passionate about was so frickinâ€™ rewarding, yo! What I loved most about it was the freedom to fully embrace the social butterfly that I am â€“ leaning into my natural role as a social connector â€“ by encouraging people to join in, starting conversations, making sure no one ever felt left out on the sidelines, and just generally keeping our vibes smooth and fun for everyone. ðŸ¦‹âœ¨ <br> <br>

                It wasnâ€™t just about titles or committee privileges just for being myself either (though, letâ€™s be real, that was pretty chill). It was about building spaces where everyone <span><em>felt part of the team</em></span>. I made it a priority that people from all kinds of backgrounds â€“ whether they were shy first-years, international students, or people trying something new for the first time â€“ felt like they belonged. Nobody got left out on my watch. ðŸ’ª <br> <br>

                The reward? Honestly, nothing beats seeing someone walk into a room nervous and quiet, then gradually light up because they feel welcome, seen, and included. That transformation, knowing I helped spark it, was the best feeling ever. It confirmed just how much I love fostering inclusivity and community wherever I go. Very <strong><em>chill</em></strong>, very <strong><em>cool</em></strong>, very <strong><em>poggers</em></strong>. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ”¥
