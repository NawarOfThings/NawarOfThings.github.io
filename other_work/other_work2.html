            <h1><span><i class='bx bxs-star'></i> HackSheffield8 Coordinator</span></h1>
            <p style="align-items: left; text-align: left;">
                After the digital exclusion charity project in spring 2024, I absolutely LOVED big project coordination – managing a team, communicating with potential partners and organisations, and seeing everything come together. So, in autumn 2024, to push myself further (and because it made perfect sense to get involved with the computer science society at my university), I ran as a candidate to volunteer for Sheffield’s 8th hackathon, HackSheffield8 – and I got in! 😈🙏 <br><br>

                Coordinating the hackathon meant leading a team of 27 student volunteers to prepare for the event – which involved a lot. From run-of-show scheduling, liaising with sponsors and raising funds, to organising the countless mini-events that happen across a 31-hour weekend, and handling all the logistics of hosting a couple hundred people – it was a huge undertaking. <br><br>

                Thanks to the competence of my team, and my focus on effective leadership and task delegation, we pulled it off: selling over 200 tickets, raising £8,500 through sponsorships from a handful of tech companies, like NetCraft and Innovative Technologies, and running a successful hackathon that left both participants and partners happy. <br><br>

                This leadership experience was a <span style="font-size: 2em; font-style: italic;">MASSIVE</span> step up from what I’d done before with ChangeLab. Eight weeks of planning became fourteen; forging one partnership became forging five; and instead of coordinating a small initiative, I was now responsible for raising over eight grand!! <br><br>

                But it was exactly this constant push beyond my limits that helped me grow. And while I found the process gruelling at the time (and honestly hated parts of it), organising and managing this event expanded my tolerance for hard work and strengthened my perseverance like nothing else has – well, except maybe doing a computer science degree 🤪 - and to that I am super grateful! :)
