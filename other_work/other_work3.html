            <h2>June 2024 ‚ûú August 2024</h2>
            <p style="align-items: left; text-align: left;">
                In Autumn 2023, I took a module called <span><em>Data Driven Computing</em></span>. It was my first proper introduction to data science, classifiers & regressors, and neural networks. What really made it stand out wasn‚Äôt just the content though ‚Äì it was the lecturer. His passion for <strong>machine learning</strong> (ML) and <strong>data science</strong> was contagious, and by the end I knew I wanted to work with him. So, in Spring 2024, I approached him with my in-the-works idea for an ML project on stock market forecasting and said: <em>"Hi, I really like your teaching style and would love to do a project on ML for stock forecasting with you, where can we go from here?‚Äù</em> <br> <br>

                He pointed me towards the <strong>Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experience</strong> (SURE) scheme, a six-to-eight week research project opportunity allowing 150 students to explore a topic of their choice each year, with a grant of <span><em>¬£1,500</em></span>. <br> Together, we planned and finalised the project, applied for the grant - and got in! That meant Summer 2024 was set: I would get to explore my two favourite technical fields, <strong><em>Finance</em></strong> and <strong><em>Machine Learning</em></strong>. <br> <br>

                The project began with a deep literature review of machine learning techniques for financial time-series. I dug into the state-of-the-art forecasting methods applied to everything from company stocks like <strong>AAPL</strong> and <strong>TSLA</strong> to volatile cryptocurrencies like <strong>BTC</strong> and <strong>ETH</strong>. <br> <br>
                
                With that foundation, I built pipelines to test and compare my supervisor‚Äôs neural stochastic differential equations (in less fancy words, very powerful) model against more traditional regressors like <strong>XGBoost</strong> and <strong>scikit-learn‚Äôs RNNs</strong>. This involved a <em>LOT</em> (with great emphasis on a lot) of trial and error ‚Äì training, testing, rebuilding, optimising parameters and pipelines, plus all the usual rounds of data cleaning and selection. <br> <br>
 
                By the end, our results were packaged into a neat and digestible dissemination poster (with interpretability front and centre), which I presented at the <span><em>SURE showcase</em></span> in November of 2024. <br>
                Sharing the work with such a large and diversely mixed audience was an incredible experience. I didn‚Äôt expect so many people to be so interested in my topic ‚Äì but they were, and the conversations were fascinating. Seeing my poster printed, displayed alongside so many other inspiring projects, and getting to explain something I love so much made it all the more rewarding. <br> <br>

                Looking back, this project was more than just a summer of research. It sharpened my technical skills, proved to me that I can take on complex ideas, and showed me how exciting it is to communicate innovative ML to others. More importantly, it improved my ability to work with ambiguity, as there were many moments where I was faced with nothing but uncertainty and doubt in where the projects was heading, and even in my own skill. <br><br>
                
                Most of all, this experience confirmed what I already suspected: <em>This is the kind of big-league work I want to be doing for years to come.</em> üöÄüî•
